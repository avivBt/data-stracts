#FibonacciHeap
 * An implementation of a Fibonacci Heap over Integers. The heap
 * is represented by two variables of the class HeapNode - one that points to
 * the left node in the highest level of the node, and one that points to the
 * node with the smallest key, and by integers that hold its size (number of
 * nodes), the number of trees in it, the number of nodes that are marked for
 * cuts, the numbers of cuts and links that have been made in the heap since its
 * initialization. defualt values are for an empty heap.
